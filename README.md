# Purpose

This is an exercise in making a React-based drag-and-drop system.

## Features

- Starts with three randomly-colored squares.
- Drag them around, and drop them on each other to do something.
- Choose between that "something" being swapping the dropped and the dropped into, or placing the dropped above the dropped into.
- Add new squares.
- Trash existing squares.
